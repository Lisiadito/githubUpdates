Work in progress

Telegram bot written in go

The goal is a bot which sends new notifications as telegram messages

To get the bot working you need to have an `.env` file with `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` set

To start the bot either run it with docker (for that check the docker/README.md) or simply run `go run main.go`.
